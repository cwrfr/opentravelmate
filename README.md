Open Travel Mate
================

Open Travel Mate is an open multi-platform transport information system.
Its goal is to simplify the life of transport users. It helps them to
find itineraries among all available transports (bus, metro, train,
taxi, car-share, ...).

The architecture is designed to be as extensible as possible. The
application is made of 2 layers:

 * Extensions written in JavaScript + HTML + CSS.
 * Native components offering functionalities to extensions via
   JavaScript interfaces.

The project target is to be a platform where transport information
providers (Transport organisation authority, Taxi company, Car-share
solutions providers, ...) can put their information at the same place,
in order to improve the visibility of their services.
